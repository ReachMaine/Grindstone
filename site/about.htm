				<blockquote>
					<p>In 1993, two long-time downeast Maine agents, Blaine 
						(Buzz) Holmes of the Holmes Agency in Ellsworth (in 
						operation since 1868) and Paul Tracy of the Winter 
						Harbor Agency in Gouldsboro, (in business since 1898) 
						desired to build a company that would make it easier for 
						the smaller Maine agency to compete in a marketplace 
						that was catering to the larger entities. Higher volume 
						demands placed on agencies by insurance carriers made it 
						increasingly difficult for the smaller organization to 
						compete with agencies that were rapidly growing through 
						acquisitions and mergers within Maine as well as across 
						state lines. <br><br>Over the next couple years, and with the capable advice 
						of Howard Candage of H. E. Candage, Inc., an action plan 
						was put in place to build a company that would cater to 
						the smaller Maine agent, allowing them to maintain their 
						complete independence and ownership while bringing 
						services to them as well as allowing them to compete in 
						a marketplace that recognized size, growth opportunities 
						and professional integrity. A benchmark of hard work, 
						perseverance and longevity, a grindstone, was selected 
						to represent their enterprise. Buzz&#8217;s and Paul&#8217;s 
						endeavor, Grindstone Financial Group, LLC, came into 
						being in 1995.<br><br>To date, Grindstone Financial 
					Group, LLC, has grown to include 20 independently owned Maine insurance agencies, 
						encompassing the majority of Maine&#8217;s vast coastline and 
						interior to the I-95 corridor. Grindstone agencies 
						represent over 30 regional and national insurance 
						carriers, writing all means of personal and commercial 
						products for Maine residents. Grindstone&#8217;s strength lies 
						in its excellent relationships between its agents and 
						each of these carriers, catering to a healthy respect 
						for our mutually beneficial goals. Although property and 
						casualty business is Grindstone&#8217;s mainstay, health and 
						financial products are available through some of its 
						participants.<br><br>Grindstone Financial Group is interested in exploring 
						new relationships with other quality Maine agents. If 
						you have an interest in joining a well-respected, 
						profitable and growing business, please contact us at
